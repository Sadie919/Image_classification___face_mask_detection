🧠 Overview
- I applied transfer learning with two models:
- Customized ResNet50
- Customized EfficientNetB0
- Both models were trained and evaluated, and the customized ResNet50 performed slightly better.

🧰 Built With
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab

📌 What’s Inside
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model setup and training
- Validation and performance comparison
