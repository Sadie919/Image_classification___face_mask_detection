# Image_classification___face_mask_detection
This project uses transfer learning with customized ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 models to classify whether a person is wearing a mask or not. ResNet50 performed slightly better. The notebook covers data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation in TensorFlow/Keras.
